# InputMethodKit Framework Sample Code

Apple's `NumberInput` sample code for creating an OS X input method using the Mac OS X Cocoa-based [InputMethodKit framework](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/InputMethodKitFrameworkRef/).

In this repository I have simply sequentially committed each stage of the `NumberInput_IMKit_Sample` project. This allows for easily viewing the additions in each stage of the sample project.
